INSTALLING AND CONFIGURING GWN MANAGER
Installing GWN Manager
# yum -y groupinstall core base "Development Tools"

1) First, we start with installing package dependencies using below commands:
yum install epel-release
yum install jemalloc libaio glibc-devel fontconfig xorg-x11-font-utils freetype

2) After downloading the bundled package from the link: https://www.grandstream.com/support/firmware
wget http://firmware.grandstream.com/GWN_Manager-1.0.19.8.tar.gz
You will need to uncompressing it using the command below:
tar -zxvf GWN_Manager-1.0.0.13-201912121121.tar.gz

3) Then install all packages, and replace the version number according to your package, in our
example the version used is 1.0.0.13.
rpm -ivh gwn*1.0.0.13*.rpm

3. Add firewall exceptions:
firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=8443/tcp –permanent
firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=10014/tcp –permanent
firewall-cmd --reload
Note: By default, GWN Manager use port 8443 for web service (nginx) and port 10014 for gateway
communication separately.

4. Run the script to start the services:
/gwn/gwn start

– Use /etc/rc.d/rc.local
This method is valid even for systemd-based distributions. In order for this method to work, you must grant execute permissions to /etc/rc.d/rc.local as follows:

# chmod +x /etc/rc.d/rc.local

#!/bin/bash
# THIS FILE IS ADDED FOR COMPATIBILITY PURPOSES
touch /var/lock/subsys/local
/gwn/gwn start
iptables -xvn -L
To see if a program or process is listening on a port, ready to accept a packet, use the netstat command.

netstat -tulnp


/gwn/gwn/nginx/access.log
